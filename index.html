    <h2>a day in the life</h2>
    <strong> Sept 22, 2025</strong>
    <p>Today started like any other, I woke up to my alarm hit snooze and went back to bed. This ordeal repeated more times than I can count, but eventually the sleep lost and I was awake. I ate a bagel for breakfast and went to Meijer to get supplies. It was the day that the script I had been working on since may was finally getting produced. Often times my scripts were almost to topical, and the butt of the joke would suffer tragedy just days before production but this was the first time in a while where that did not happen. I arrived on set and my actors were in costume perfectly. The subject was a satire about modern cop tv shows. My script laid the scene, a by the book sargent and his rebellious detective looking to stop one thing serial urination. The original script was <em>"Too graphic"</em> So I pivoted, I tried to make as many pee themed jokes in two pages and succeded. </p>
